# Introduction 
**Goals:**
Create method to lower friction for our customers to experience detections (and associating attacks) as much as possible.

Push on GitHub to make publicly available and commit forks/feedback from the community.

This is meant to be foundational to Attack Simulation Playbooks going forward, to simulate *real live* environments.

**Methods:**
Leverage automation capabilities including:
* ARM Templates (Azure VM provisioning)
* PowerShell (System hydration, Active Directory Hydration, AzureRM)

# Getting Started
To be filled out once ARM Template sequencing is complete.
