# Introduction 
Used by Microsoft C+AI team to train and educate their customers and Partners on techniques used by red team and determined human adversaries. All too often, simply setting up a lab environment to do these attack techniques is too difficult or cumbersome so it often is skipped.  This is a mistake.

Leveraging [Azure DevTest Lab (DTL)](https://aka.ms/dtl), Microsoft C+AI Security team can provide not just an [Azure ATP SA Playbook](https://aka.ms/aatpsaplaybook) which guides you on methods and techniques, but we can leverage the DTL functionality to hydrate an environment quickly so our customers can spend more time learning and training around these techniques vs managing a lab environment.

# Getting Started
Follow these high level steps to get started quickly in a lab environment 
1. Follow the Azure DevTest Lab guidance to create a new DevTest Lab within an Azure Subscription.
2. Follow [this guidance on how to re-use this repository for your own purposes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/lab-services/devtest-lab-add-artifact-repo)
